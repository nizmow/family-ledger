# Family ledger

This is the Beancount ledger for my family.

## General approach

* Refer to Beancount documentation at https://beancount.github.io/docs/index.html as a first point of reference for Beancount functionality.
* Use modern `uv` for Python management, including running tests.
* If in doubt, search the web.
